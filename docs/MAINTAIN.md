# Guidelines

Here we are explaining how to maintain this project

## Process
(Cette partie devrait p-e etre à l'attention des gens qui vont continuer à maintenir le repo et placee dans docs/maintaining.md ?)
 1. Go to the slack channel **#code-daily-programmer** and retrieve the exercice of the day.
  2. Go to this repository's project **Daily exercices** and create a note in the targeted column.
  3. Convert the note into an issue.
  4. Edit the issue and paste the content of the exercice.
  5. Organize the content into 3 titles :  
    - Source (meaning url where the exercice comes from).  
    - Exercice (the content of the exercise itself).  
    - Hints.
